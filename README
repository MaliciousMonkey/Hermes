Written By Matt Bertolini

About Hermes
============

Hermes gives developers using GWT the ability to use their I18N properties files 
on the server-side. This library is a fork of the gwt-i18n-server project 
located at http://code.google.com/p/gwt-i18n-server/. Hermes supports the 
Messages, Constants, and ConstantsWithLookup interfaces. Date and number 
formatting and Plural forms are supported on the Messages interfaces.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why did you fork gwt-i18n-server?
---------------------------------

I forked the gwt-i18n-server library because development appeared to be dormant 
on the existing codebase and I needed bugs fixed. I had submitted some patches 
to the original developer but no work had been done on the code for over a year. 
I made the decision to fix the bugs myself and the fork was born. Just about 
every line of code has been re-written to make the library more compatible with 
GWT I18N implementation.

I found a bug. What do I do?
----------------------------

If you find a bug or other issue with Hermes, please file an issue at 
https://github.com/MaliciousMonkey/Hermes/issues. When filing a bug, please

* Version of GWT
* Type of interface (Messages, Constants, ConstantsWithLookup
* The properties string that is not working

Giving this information will help me track down the issue and write unit tests 
to make sure I fix the bug.
