Written By Matt Bertolini

About Hermes
============

Hermes gives developers using GWT the ability to use their I18N properties files 
on the server-side. This library is a fork of the gwt-i18n-server project 
located at http://code.google.com/p/gwt-i18n-server/. Hermes supports the 
Messages, Constants, and ConstantsWithLookup interfaces. SafeHtml, Date and 
number formatting, and Plural forms are supported on the Messages interfaces.

License
=======

Hermes is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1. See the 
LICENSE file for full license information.

Requirements
============

Hermes version 1.2 requires Java 1.6, GWT 2.2, and ICU 4.6 to run. If you need 
GWT 2.1 support, use the 1.1.x line.

Differences Between Hermes and GWT I18N
=======================================

* Since the server side does not have access to the GWT locale information, you 
  are required to pass the locale to Hermes in order to get the correct data.

* The locale hierarchy and fallback system as described in the GWT Constants 
  Javadoc is not supported. The locale given to Hermes must match a valid 
  properties file or it will use the default properties file.
  
* Plural form exact values and offsets are not supported.

* GWT extension {name,text}, {0,list}, {0,localdatetime,skeleton}, and extra 
  formatter arguments are not supported.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why did you fork gwt-i18n-server?
---------------------------------

I forked the gwt-i18n-server library because development appeared to be dormant 
on the existing codebase and I needed bugs fixed. I had submitted some patches 
to the original developer but no work had been done on the code for over a year. 
I made the decision to fix the bugs myself and the fork was born. Just about 
every line of code has been re-written to make the library more compatible with 
GWT I18N implementation.

I found a bug. What do I do?
----------------------------

If you find a bug or other issue with Hermes, please file an issue at 
https://github.com/MaliciousMonkey/Hermes/issues. When filing a bug, please 
provide the following information:

* Version of Hermes
* Version of GWT
* Type of interface (Messages, Constants, ConstantsWithLookup)
* The properties string that is not working
* Any arguments passed to the method for inclusion into the string
* The observed output
* The expected output

Giving this information will help me track down the issue and write unit tests 
to make sure I fix the bug.

Also, if you have found a bug and already found a fix, patches and pull 
requests are welcome. Please make sure you include unit tests to verify the fix.
