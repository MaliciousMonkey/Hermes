Hermes Change Log
=================

Version 1.2.0 -- 2011-05-12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
* Support for GWT 2.2 and above. GWT 2.2 introduced multiple plural arguments, 
the @Select annotation, and the @AlternateMessage annotation. Support for these 
features has been added. Version 1.2 of Hermes no longer works with GWT 2.1. If 
you are using GWT 2.1, use the 1.1.x line of Hermes.

Version 1.1.0 -- 2011-04-24

  follows the specification and documentation found in the GWT plural forms 
  documentation.
Bug Fixes:
* Fixed bug in unit test MessagesProxyTest where date related tests would fail 
  if run outside the America/New_York time zone (Issue #1).
